# PID optimizer for Tensorflow

Tensorflow implementation of PID optimization (CVPR 2018).

See the following paper for detail of algorithm.

- [A PID Controller Approach for Stochastic Optimization of Deep Networks](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/%7Ecslzhang/paper/CVPR18_PID.pdf)

This program was tested on Tensorflow r1.4.

## Implementation in other frameworks

- PyTorch
